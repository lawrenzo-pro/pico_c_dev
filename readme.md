# My Adventures or the raspberry pi pico w

## Prerequisites
Have the Pico C/C++ sdk installed in your system.
If you use arch linux you can install it from the AUR using your favourite helper
```bash
yay -S pico-sdk
```
This will also install other dependancies such as cmake

## Usage
This wasn't meant for public use but I created a code workspace to simplify it.  
If you have vscode and the C/C++,Cmake extensions you should be good to go

## Corrections and Contributions
I'm a beginner at this so feel free to make suggestions on how I can improve my code.  
Issues and pull requests are always welcomed.

Thank you.
